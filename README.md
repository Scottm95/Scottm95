# Hi, I'm Scott 👋

I'm a reporting / BI analyst focused on building self-serve dashboards and automated reporting workflows that make performance reporting faster, clearer and more reliable.

I work end-to-end: extracting and cleaning operational datasets, modelling data for reporting, building KPI definitions/measures, and delivering stakeholder-ready dashboards and MI packs.

Recent work includes:

Contact Centre KPI Dashboard (Genesys Cloud call data) — SQL + Power BI

End-to-end Customer Journey MI Suite — Power BI + SharePoint/Power Query

Credit Monitoring Dashboard — SQL + Power BI

Automated reporting pipeline (CSV → cleaned Excel → SharePoint) — Python + Power Automate

Team Leader Performance Dashboard — Excel + Power Query



Based in Glasgow and currently seeking BI / MI / Data Analyst roles where I can build scalable reporting solutions and support better decisions.
