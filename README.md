# Hi, I'm Scott 👋

I'm a data-driven analyst specialising in Power BI, SQL, Excel (Power Query), and Python automation.
I build dashboards, data models, and workflows that make reporting faster, clearer, and more reliable.

I work across the full data lifecycle; from cleaning and transforming operational datasets, to designing multi-page analytics dashboards, to automating manual reporting processes.
Recent projects include:

Contact Centre KPI Dashboard (SQL + Power BI, using Genesys Cloud call data) 

End-to-end customer journey dashboard (Power BI)

Team Leader performance dashboard (Excel + Power Query)

Credit monitoring dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

Python → Power Automate reporting automation pipeline

I'm currently based in Glasgow and moving into a dedicated Business Intelligence / Data Analyst role where I can apply technical skills to real business problems, improve decision-making, and build impactful reporting solutions.
