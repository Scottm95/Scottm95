# Hi, I'm Scott ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data-focused professional with a passion for turning raw data into clear, actionable insights.  
I specialise in **Power BI**, **SQL**, **Excel**, **Python**, and **automation**, building dashboards and workflows that make reporting faster, cleaner, and more useful.  

I enjoy working across the full data lifecycle â€” from cleaning and modelling data, to designing interactive dashboards, to automating repetitive processes.  
My recent projects include **KPI monitoring dashboards**, **data cleaning pipelines**, and **reporting automation**.

Currently based in Glasgow and looking to move into a dedicated **Data Analyst** role where I can bring technical skills and problem-solving to business challenges.
